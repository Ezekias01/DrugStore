# *pharmacy management*
![N|Solid](https://www.boomerangcard.it/it/uploads/esercente/54/logo.png "")

The project aims to model a computer system for the management of a pharmacy. The modeling hypothesis to which the project will adhere will be that of a rural pharmacy, whose staff is composed solely of the Managing Director, responsible for the sale of drugs and the execution of swabs.

The system will provide the Administrator with access to functionality that allows the management of a number of operations such as:

- Registration of sales at the counter
- Warehouse management (including order creation to the supplier)
- Archives Management
- Management of the buffer area (reservation and execution )

# installation
The software was developed in Python with the help of PyCharm.
