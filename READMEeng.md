The project aims to model a computer system for the management of a pharmacy. The modeling hypothesis to which the project will adhere will be that of a rural pharmacy, whose staff is composed solely of the Managing Director, responsible for the sale of drugs and the execution of swabs.

The system will provide the Administrator with access to functionality that allows the management of a number of operations such as:

- Management of the buffer area (reservation and execution )
- Warehouse management (including order creation to the supplier)
- Sales management at the counter
- Archives Management
